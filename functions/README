A function is a reusable sequence of statements designed to do a particular job.
Functions that you write yourself are called user-defined functions.
A function call is an expression that tells the CPU to interrupt the current function and execute another function. 
The CPU “puts a bookmark” at the current point of execution, and then calls (executes) the function named in the function call.
When the called function ends, the CPU returns back to the point it bookmarked, and resumes execution.

The function initiating the function call is called the caller, and the function being called is the callee or called function.


return-type identifier() // identifier replaced with the name of your function
{
// Your code here
}

For now, identifier will simply be replaced with the name of your user-defined function.
The curly braces and statements in between are called the function body.
